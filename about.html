    <h2>Get to know me!</h2>
<p>
      Hi! I'm Alyssa Rose, a passionate web developer and designer with a love for creativity and innovation. 
      I have a background in graphic design and video editing, which has helped me develop a keen eye for aesthetics 
      and user experience. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think outside the box and push the boundaries 
      of what's possible in web development. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new design trends, taking photos, 
      or managing social media accounts for various brands. I'm excited to share my work and connect with others in the industry 
      through this portfolio website!
    </p>
  <h2>Who I am?</h2>
    <p>
      I am a marketing professional from the Pittsburgh Area. I am the oldest of 4 sisters, 
      and I have 3 cats. I love sports, especially soccer and hockey. I am a huge fan of the 
      Pittsburgh Penguins and The Portland Thorns. I also enjoy traveling and trying new foods. 
      I have a passion for web development and design, and I am always looking for new opportunities 
      to learn and grow in this field. I am a plant lover and have a small collection of succulents and 
      houseplants that I care for. I am also a coffee enthusiast and enjoy trying different blends and 
      brewing methods. Overall, I am a creative and driven individual who is excited to share my work and 
      connect with others in the industry through this portfolio website!
